First, users must create a registration. After creating a registration, they log in and come to the panel where the game channels are located. They can see the online users in this panel. They can send a request by typing the name of one of these users. If the other party approves the request, the game phase will begin. At this stage, the competitors first send each other the words they will guess. After the words are sent, the word guessing phase is started, where points are received based on correct letter guesses in the word. The one who guesses in the shortest time wins the game.
